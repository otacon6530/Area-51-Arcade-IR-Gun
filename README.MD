# Area-51-Arcade-IR-Gun
Create an Arduino Uno powered IR gun to replace the light gun used in the Area 51 arcade cabinet, so you can use an LCD screen in place of a CRT.

*WARNING*: This is in active development and may not be in a working state. When I am able to use it no matter how terribly I will do a release.
